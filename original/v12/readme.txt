 SUCCESSFULLY TESTED ON:

 SHORT DESCRIPTION:

 A slideshow of several graphic-modes for the C128 with 64K VDC
 
 - 640x480 interlace 8x2 color resolution
 - 640x576 interlace 8x3 color resolution
 - 480x252 non-interlace 8x1 color resolution
 - 640x400 non-interlace 8x2 color resolution
 - 720x700 interlace monochrome
 - 800x600 interlace monochrome
 - 950x540 interlace monochrome
 - two text modes with larger screen area

 This little demo shows some rare graphic modes on the VDC with some
 converted images. Very colorfur pictures in resolutions of 640x480 or
 640x576 are possible as well as high resolution of up to 720x700,
 800x600 or 960x540 pixels. Also two text modes are included which
 provide a larger used screen area. Converters and sources are included.

 INSTRUCTIONS:

 The demo consists of several d64, d71, d81 or an all-in-one
 sd2iec-version. The first file of each disk is autobooting on the C128
 (or just run "vdc mode mania") to start the viewer. Please note  that not
 all modes will display on all monitors. They are sorted in likeliness of
 display compatibility. VDC-IHFLI and VDC-ITFLI should work on most
 devices, while VDC-HFLI and VDC-IMONO use very low vertical frequencies
 for which you will most likely have to adjust the vertical sync and
 vertical size on your monitor - if you have those controls.
 VDC-IM800 should work on most devices, but you may see the borders cut
 off. You should use the horizontal size and vertical size controls on
 your monitor (if you have them) to squeeze the picture to fit.
 VDC-IM960 was specifically created for the RGBtoHDMI-device and will
 most likely not work on other display devices.

 The converters for the color graphics work on the PC and expect a .ppm
 (Portable Pixel Map)-file to convert in exactly the right resolution
 named 'input.ppm' - it then produces some files which can be read by the
 appropriate -view BASIC-application on the C128.
 
 The converters for the monochrome 720x700, 800x600 and 960x540 modes are
 simple BASIC-programs which expect a .pgm (Portable Graymap)-file. I
 suggest  using this one in VICE and warp-mode.

 If you want to know more about those modes in general, please also have a
